# Course files for Power BI Bootcamp (PBI365)
This repository is used to maintain student files required when attending Power BI Bootcamp with Critical Path Training or one of our courseware licensing partners. 
##Why are we maintaining our student files in GitHub?
Our goal is to update the student files monthly to keep in sync with the cloud cadence of the Power BI platform.
